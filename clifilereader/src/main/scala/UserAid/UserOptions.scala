          * I'm sure you guys have heard this from me, but I like to program for applications
          * One thing that it provides is the ability to create a resource file called 'res'
          * This is a folder that let's us allocate immutable resources for presentation, like strings
          * It's strange though, because the resources themselves are stored differently
          * In Android Apps, you would store the resources in an XML string array, and reference the item
          * We haven't been over this yet, perhaps we can talk about it later....
          * 
          * Separating hard coded strings into resources is more of an architectural thing, but still practical
