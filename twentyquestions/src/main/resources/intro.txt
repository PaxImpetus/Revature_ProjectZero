This is a Survey Game.
We will ask you questions - some personal, some silly.
You can expect to be asked simple answers, but the content is the issue.
You are free to refrain from any questions asked
There will be several different surveys, and you will be able to view aggregate statistics of everyone who participated in each survey.

---Mimimum Viable Product will simply present stats
---End Goal will provide complex tools to perform arithemtic operations on metrics
